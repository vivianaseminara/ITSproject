                    The query searches for all architectural or landscape assets (represented by ?cp) classified as 'church' and linked to a region (?regionId). Subsequently, it counts the number of churches for each region and arranges the results in descending order based on the count of churches (from the highest number to the lowest). This query unveils an uneven distribution of churches across different regions. Specifically, we will further investigate the churches and architectural styles present in Sicily, which currently only has 26 identified churches under ID 19. This finding underscores certain gaps within the Knowledge Graph.

                    The query seeks all architectural or landscape assets classified as "church" and featuring a cultural style containing the term "baroque". It then counts the occurrences of each baroque style and organizes the results in descending order based on frequency. Now, let's shift our attention to the architectural styles found in Italy, with a particular emphasis on the baroque style. Based on information available online, the baroque style is notably prominent in the regions of Sicily, Lazio (including Rome), and Puglia. Our intention is to corroborate this information through a query of the Knowledge Graph (KG).

                <p>
                    Following a detailed interrogation phase of the Arco ontology, a surprising finding has emerged regarding the distribution of churches in the Sicilian territory compared to other regions. 
                    The number of churches in Sicily is significantly lower, suggesting a potential underrepresentation in the database. From an architectural perspective, an in-depth analysis has revealed that over 80 Sicilian churches are classified as Baroque, according to Wikipedia. However, only 8 of these Baroque churches are actually present in the Arco ontology database. This is particularly significant considering that the ontology includes over 350 Baroque churches in total. This discrepancy clearly indicates a notable lack of data regarding Sicilian churches, especially those of Baroque style, in the Arco database. Such a gap poses a barrier to the comprehensive and accurate understanding of Sicilian architectural heritage, highlighting the importance of a more thorough and extensive data collection and input effort. The following section will explore how the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be an effective tool in improving the population of the ontology, thereby contributing to a more accurate and complete representation of Sicilian churches and their historical and artistic value.

                    The rdfs:label field is correct, but it is necessary to consider adding dc:title. We are aware of the ID of the region, therefore it is possible to use Arco which equals 19. The arco:ReligiousBuilding does not exist, instead it is necessary to apply arco:ArchitecturalOrLandscapeHeritage. The architectural “baroque” style falls under the a-cd:hasAuthorshipAttribution, a-cd:hasCulturalScope, rdfs:label Barrocco  properties. The properties hasFeatures can include internal decorations, paintings, artworks. However, such property does not exist but can be placed under the entity core:hasPart. ChatGPT was not able to provide the author. Therefore, it is possible to query again, specifying the question and obtaining the new property. The KG does not include the arco:isDedicatedTo, but it could be added.

                    Upon initial examination, it becomes evident that LLaMa 2 adeptly extracts a greater amount of information during the preliminary phase without necessitating additional queries to the LLM engine. However, it exhibits notable shortcomings in translating from RDF format to the Arco ontology. For instance, details pertaining to architectural style and construction dates are either entirely absent or only partially present within the description itself, failing to be extracted as new entities or relations. Conversely, the retrieval of location information proves to be particularly noteworthy. The dc:title field is correct, but it is necessary to consider adding rdfs:lable. Instead of using arco:church, it is necessary to add dc:type church. The architectural “baroque” style falls under the a-cd:hasAuthorshipAttribution, a-cd:hasCulturalScope, rdfs:label Baroque. Regarding the location, it is possible to link it to dcterms:spatial and create an entity for the Acireale city. For instance: https://w3id.org/arco/resource/Address/bd72c50c385b1ad5aecb76b354427e6d

                <p>
                    From initial observations, it is evident that Gemini is able to extract more information effectively, but only if asking an in-depth and detailed query about the specific church at hand. In the final phase, Gemini highlights the challenge of translating with the Arco ontology, as it only offers properties that it can translate, omitting details on special events related to the church, construction dates and architectural styles: the skos:prefLabel field is replaced by rdfs:label. The arco:hasDescription is replaced by dc:description. Regarding the location, it is possible to link it to dcterms:spatial, creating an entity for the Acireale city. For example: https://w3id.org/arco/resource/Address/bd72c50c385b1ad5aecb76b354427e6d

                    In this example, the few-shot prompt query technology is used to attempt a correct translation. Following the logic of few-shot learning, examples of correct and incorrect translations are provided to the language model (LLM), allowing the artificial intelligence to learn how to make an accurate translation. In this case, as shown by the screenshot, the model produced a correct translation because of the examples provided. However, there appear to be few features extracted for each church, making translation by ChatGPT easier. It would be interesting to see how the model performs with a larger number of features. In addition, there are no common errors in mistranslations, such as the absence of < > symbols or quotation marks in strings, errors that the model previously made.

                <p>
                    Generated Knowledge Prompting technology consists of a method of interacting with artificial intelligence models to obtain more accurate and complete answers. This method takes advantage of the model's ability to generate and update knowledge based on the context provided.

Here is how it works:

Initial question without context: A question is asked of the model (e.g., ChatGPT) without providing any context. This is used to obtain a basic answer, which may be incomplete or generic.

Adding context: After obtaining the initial answer, you provide the model with additional context. This context may include specific details, additional information, or clarification of the original question.

Repeated question with context: You ask the same question again to the model, but this time with additional context. The model uses the new information to generate a more detailed and relevant answer.

Use of enriched knowledge: The new, more complete and informative answer can be further used to query other artificial intelligence models (such as LLaMa and Gemini) or to further enrich the knowledge graph.

This approach allows the quality of the answers to be progressively improved, taking full advantage of the machine learning models' ability to process and integrate new information.

The goal is to understand whether the "isDedicatedTo" feature is essential to represent a church, as it was proposed during the knowledge graph enrichment phase. Recall that this feature was suggested but is not present in Arco.

We begin by posing a question to ChatGPT without providing any context. ChatGPT responds with a "No." Next, we provide ChatGPT with additional information and repeat the question. This time, ChatGPT offers us additional knowledge. With the new question enriched with information, we then query LLaMa and Gemini.

                    In both cases, it gives us a detailed explanation of why it does not make sense to have a dedication in churches. Therefore, you may ultimately decide not to include such a feature.

                The initial project aimed to conduct an in-depth analysis of Italy's architectural heritage, with a particular focus on churches, to extract information on architectural styles. However, after an extensive exploration of SPARQL queries within the ArCo ontology, the results revealed a significant gap in the representation of Sicilian churches in the database. While external sources, such as Wikipedia, classify over 80 Sicilian churches as Baroque, the ArCo ontology currently documents only 8.

                Consequently, the main goal became to enrich the ontology with new data. For this purpose, several language models (LLMs) were used and the following observations emerged:
                
                <ol>

                <li>ChatGPT: It was particularly effective in translating and converting information into the ArCo ontology, probably due to the presence of relevant data in its initial training dataset.</li>

                <li>LlaMA: While it excelled in the initial phase of information extraction, it showed significant shortcomings in the final phase of translation into the ArCo ontology.</li>

                <li>Gemini: It recorded high performance, although more in-depth answers were expected. A distinguishing feature of Gemini from other models is its ability to flag translation problems in the ArCo ontology, highlighting what it fails to translate correctly.</li>

                <li>Mistral: As an emergent model, it failed to answer the first question, probably due to its immaturity and limited training on these specific categories. </li>

                </ol>

                Strengths were identified for each model, and finally an example query was proposed for entering new data into the ontology.
